## Testing c++ (cpp) app using github actions

## Continuous integration for a c++ application using Qt GitHub Action


-------------------------
Environment:

- IDE: Qt
- Language: C++
- OS: ubuntu


Motivation: The aim of this project is to set up continuous integration (CI) for a c++ application with GitHub actions. I added automation script to build and test the app on GitHub.
In this way we might be able to detect bug in the remote repository.

steps:

- Create a hello world cpp app using Qt IDE.
- add integration script to build and compile the application in github actions.
